# Interactive product viewer "RevolveItem"

## Review
This open source project provides an interactive way to browse products in an e-commerce environment, improving the online shopping experience by allowing shoppers to explore products from multiple perspectives and perspectives. The project is under active development, contributions are welcome.

### Features
- **360 Degree View**: Approximately 30 consecutive images are used to create a rotating effect, providing a full 360 degree view of the product.
- **Panoramic View**: Uses the Three.js library to project images onto a sphere, providing an interior view from a central point. This mode is ideal for realistically depicting the inside or outside of spherical objects. To create a 360 panorama, I recommend using the PTGui program.
- **View 3D model**: (under development). This feature will allow users to interact with a 3D model created from product images. Users can rotate and inspect the model to see all the details, which improves understanding of the physical characteristics of the product.
